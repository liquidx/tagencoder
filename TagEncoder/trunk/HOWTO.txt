Short Tutorial on how to build a Python MacOSX App
==================================================

Introduction

Generally, this is a short tutorial on how to setup a simple development environment to write a Python App. 


Interface Building
------------------

You'll need to use Interface Building which is bunlded along with the Apple Devleopment Tools which comes with every distribution of MacOSX. 

Create a new interface and then save it in your project directory under:

<project_name>/English.lproj/MainMenu.nib


A Simple Python Executable
--------------------------

Now, just create a python script with the following in your <project_name> directory:

<project_name>/<project_name>.py

from PyObjCTools import NibClassBuilder, AppHelper

NibClassBuilder.extractClasses("MainMenu")

if __name__ == "__main__":
	AppHelper.runEventLoop()


Python buildapp.py script
-------------------------

Now to create a very simple build script to build your application:

from bundlebuilder import buildapp

buildapp(
    name = "<project_name>",
    mainprogram = "<project_name>.py",
    resources = ["Resources/English.lproj"],
    nibname = "MainMenu",
)


Building
--------
Run in the directory:

python buildapp.py --link build
